==========
Tools to populate FluidInfo with taxonomy data.



Pointers to stuff
-----------------
There seems to exist a tool that returns JSON formatted results, but it requires
an API key that must be requested, as documented here:
   http://entrezajax.appspot.com/developer.html
   
The corresponding uri would be:
http://entrezajax.appspot.com/elink?dbfrom=taxonomy&id=9482&cmd=llinks&apikey=<A registered API key>
